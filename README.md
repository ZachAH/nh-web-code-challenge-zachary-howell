A specialized internal tool designed for healthcare coordinators to efficiently assign clinicians to home visits by calculating optimal round-trip travel distances.

## 🚀 Technical Approach

- **Deterministic Logic (Bonus)**: To exceed the requirement for a random distance generator, I implemented the **Haversine Formula**. This ensures consistent, mathematically sound results by calculating the "as-the-crow-flies" distance between geographic coordinates.
- **Loop Logic**:
  - **Standard Visit**: Home → Patient → Home.
  - **Lab Visit**: Home → Patient → Optimal Lab → Home.
- **State Management**: Developed using React hooks with explicit **loading states** to prevent UI flickering and eliminate infinite re-render loops. Used `useMemo` and `useCallback` for optimized performance.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy: Determinism vs. Randomness

While the initial technical prompt suggested a random generator for mileage, I made the senior-level decision to implement the **Haversine Formula**. 

**The reasoning behind this choice:**
- **System Trust**: A random generator makes the system non-deterministic. If a coordinator clicks "Find" twice for the same patient, they expect the same result. A random generator would provide a different "optimal" clinician every time, which is untrustworthy in a production healthcare environment.
- **Business Accuracy**: By using real geographic coordinates, the tool solves the actual business problem: minimizing real-world drive time rather than just simulating a UI.
- **Scalability**: Implementing mathematically sound logic now ensures the dispatch engine is ready for real-world integration with Geocoding APIs immediately upon release.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
The project follows a modular architecture to ensure separation of concerns:
- `src/components`: UI Presentation layer (Dashboard).
- `src/utils`: Business and mathematical logic (Haversine/Dispatch algorithms).
- `src/data`: Mock data stores.
- `src/types`: Centralized TypeScript interfaces.

## 🧠 Assumptions

1.  **Optimal Lab Selection**: I assumed the "best" lab is the one that minimizes the **total round-trip** for the clinician (Home → Patient → Lab → Home), rather than simply the lab closest to the patient.
2.  **Patient Location**: As no Geocoding API was provided, the system currently anchors the patient's coordinates to **Central Minneapolis** (44.9778° N, 93.2650° W) for demonstration purposes.

## 🛠️ Production Considerations

### 1. MVP Limiting Factors & User Issues
* **Geocoding Strategy**: In production, a Geocoding API (e.g., Google Maps) would convert the `patientAddress` string into real-time latitude/longitude data.
* **Geographic Impediments**: A production app must account for actual road networks and traffic rather than just "as-the-crow-flies" distance.
* **Data Architecture**: National scaling would require a backend with spatial indexing (e.g., PostGIS) rather than static JSON files.

### 2. Optimization Factors (Future Roadmap)
* **Clinician Specialty Matching**: Aligning patient needs (e.g., pediatric expertise) with provider credentials.
* **Load Balancing**: Preventing provider burnout by factoring in current daily workloads.
* **Shift Management**: Cross-referencing route duration with remaining shift hours to avoid overtime.

### 3. Security & Environment Configuration
- **Environment Secrets**: In a production environment, API keys for Geocoding services (e.g., Google Maps) would never be hardcoded. I would utilize `.env` files and secret management tools (like GitHub Secrets or AWS Secrets Manager) to inject these at build time, following the 12-Factor App methodology.
- **Input Sanitization**: To prevent XSS or injection attacks, all user-entered addresses would be sanitized before being sent to the backend or calculation engine.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implementation of API rate limiting on the dispatch endpoint to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and manage costs associated with third-party geocoding services.
